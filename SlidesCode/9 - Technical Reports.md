# Making Your Outline

- Make it detailed!
    - The more you plan, the less you have to do later
- What sections will your report need?
    - Name them now!
- Choose a method that works for you
    - Flash cards you can organize
    - Mind Maps
    - Bullet points in a document
    - Whatever you like!

# Step 5 - Write the First Draft

1. Write a draft right after you complete your outline
2. Review this draft for technical accuracy/organization
3. Review the draft to focus on wording and clarity

**THIS IS STILL JUST THE FIRST DRAFT!**

# Step 6 - Revise the Draft (REPEATED)

1. Set the draft aside for a while (maybe a couple days)
2. Review the draft for
    a. Substance (Do you support your conclusions? Are the visuals and tables necessary?)
    b. Is the organization clear and appropriate?
    c. Spelling, grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.

Each review should be complete and independent of the others. At this point, you should have worked through your document **AT LEAST SIX TIMES**
