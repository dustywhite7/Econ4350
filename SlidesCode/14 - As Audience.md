# How do you consume a presentation?- For real this time

What is the right way to participate as audience to a presentation?

**Write down your thoughts before we move forward**

---

# Roles reversed

- Find ways to relate to the presenter, and to engage with the material
- Look for the key points in the presentation
- Think of questions to ask
- Look for the supporting evidence for arguments presented

---

# Relating to presenters

Some make it easy, others make it hard!
- What about the topic interests you?
- How can you apply the material to problems that you are trying to solve?
- Do you have information that would help the presenter as he/she moves forward? (Share it after the presentation!)

---

# What are the key points?

Write them down somewhere! Look for how those points are meant to help you make better decisions.

---

# What questions do I have?

You should have questions! Ask them! (as permitted by the presentation format)

- Why do you use that data source?
- Why do you use that form of analysis?
- Are there other possible conclusions based on the results?
- So many other questions!

---

# Find the supporting evidence

Look for the presenter's evidence for their arguments. Be skeptical, and keep asking questions until you know whether or not to believe what is being presented!
- **It is okay to disagree** if you do not find the evidence compelling!

---

# Remember

Every presentation has two sides! Make sure you can excel at each role!

---

# The end of the term

Thanks so much!
