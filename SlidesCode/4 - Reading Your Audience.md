# Reading the Audience and Presenting

---

# Acting or Presenting?

When we present, we should not present as if there is no one else in the room. 

Our relationship with the audience will dictate in part how much our work is trusted.

    - Know what you are talking about, but improvise on the delivery
    - This is easy when you have spent enough time learning the material

# How do you consume a presentation?- For real this time

What is the right way to participate as audience to a presentation?


---

# Roles reversed

- Find ways to relate to the presenter, and to engage with the material
    - Look for the key points in the presentation
    - Think of questions to ask
    - Look for the supporting evidence (or lack) for arguments presented

---

# Relating to presenters

Some make it easy, others make it hard!
- What about the topic interests you?
- How can you apply the material to problems that you are trying to solve?
- Do you have information that would help the presenter as he/she moves forward? (Share it after the presentation!)

---

# What are the key points?

Write them down somewhere! Look for how those points are meant to help you make better decisions.

- I just learned how to do this with football YESTERDAY!

---

# What questions do I have?

You should have questions! Ask them! (as permitted by the presentation format)

- Why do you use that data source?
- Why do you use that form of analysis?
- Are there other possible conclusions based on the results?
- So many other questions!

---

# Find the supporting evidence

Look for the presenter's evidence for their arguments. Be skeptical, and keep asking questions until you know whether or not to believe what is being presented!
- **It is okay to disagree** if you do not find the evidence compelling!

---

# Remember

Every presentation has two sides! You should excel at each!
