# What's a Map?

Do we really need to start here??

# Fine, fine...

But really, what do maps have to do with data?

---

# About data

Data is a stored representation of the real world. If anything, maps are some of the realest data that we can experience.

---

# But why put it on a map?

---

# What do we need?

In order to create maps, we need the following:
1. Some geographic marker(s)
2. Data related to those markers

---

# Geographic markers

Depending on what your data looks like, geographic markers might be **place names** or **coordinates**

---

# Data for our maps

What kind of data have you seen represented on a map?

1) Elevation (topographic maps)
2) Routes
3) Shapes of regions
4) Data about locations (age, unemployment, income, internet access, favorite sports team, etc.)

---

# Should we always use maps?

Not necessarily! We use maps when **geography aids understanding**

Remember that unnecessary information in a visual just makes it harder to find the critical point!
